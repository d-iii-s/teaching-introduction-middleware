        A key pair where data encrypted with one key (private or public) \\
        can be decrypted with the other one (public or private).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Public key available, private key kept secret
            \item Encrypting with public key, signing with private key

    \begin{block}{Shared Secret Agreement}
        A process through which parties can agree on a shared secret \\
        without actually transmitting the shared secret itself.

    \bigskip

    have $p$ and $g$ where $g$ is a generator of multiplicative integer group modulo $p$ \\

    \bigskip

    Alice: pick $a$ and publish $g^a ~ (modulo ~ p)$ \\
    Bob: pick $b$ and publish $g^b ~ (modulo ~ p)$ \\

    then $(g^a)^b = (g^b)^a$ is a shared secret \\

            \item Pick a random combination of fields.
            \item Query information on current time.
            \item Print the time.

\begin{frame}{Authorization Process Participants}
    \begin{block}{Resource Owner}
        This is the end user who authorizes third party clients to access resources. \\
        The resource owner accesses the third party client through a browser.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Resource Server}
        This is the server that provides access to resources \\
        when shown authorization in the form of access token.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Third Party Client}
        This is the application that needs to access \\
        resources on behalf of resource owner.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Authorization Server}
        This is the server that can authenticate the resource owner \\
        and issues access tokens as directed by the resource owner.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Authorization Process Sketch}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mini]
[OWN] Accesses an application link that needs authorization.

[APP] Responds with REDIRECT sending the browser to authorization server.
      The link includes CLIENT ID and SCOPE and arbitrary STATE.

[OWN] The browser follows the link to the authorization server.

[AUT] The server authenticates the user behind the browser.
      The user is then asked to grant authorization for SCOPE.
      The server concludes with REDIRECT back to the application.
      The link includes AUTHORIZATION CODE and associated application STATE.

[OWN] The browser follows the link to the application.

[APP] The application gets the AUTHORIZATION CODE from the link.
      The application asks the authorization server to convert
      the AUTHORIZATION CODE into an ACCESS TOKEN.

[AUT] The server generates the ACCESS TOKEN as requested.

[APP] The application accesses the resource server
      with the ACCESS TOKEN included in request header.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}


% Server Applications
% - Process assumes application can keep access token secret
% - Steps
%   - Have user follow link to authorization request page
%     The link contains
%     - client ID (assigned previously by administration)
%     - redirect URI (registered previously with administration)
%     - expected response type (server applications ask for authorization code)
%     - scope (what authorization the server wants, application specific)
%     - state (arbitrary string, application specific)
%   - The authorization server will authenticate the user and ask for permission
%     If permission is granted then the authorization request page will
%     go to redirect URI and provide state and authorization code
%     and possibly scope if that changed
%   - The server application asks the authorization server
%     to exchange the authorization code for
%     an access token using a POST request
%     - sends redirect URI and code and client ID
%     - also sends client secret (secret, assigned previously by administration)
%     - gets back access token with expiration time and possibly refresh token
% - Notable
%   - The access token never passes through the browser
%   - Only owner of client secret can convert authorization code to access code

% Browser Applications
% - Run in a browser so cannot have client secret in code
% - Same as previous except last step
%   - Client secret is not sent
%   - Not clear why this is fine
%   - This is not the spec way
%     - Spec provides simplified implicit grant handshake
%     - Spec points out the client is not really authenticated

% Finally
% - The access token is simply inserted to HTTP request headers
%   - This is called bearer token
%   - Other types also possible

% Tidbits
% - Standard actually allows significant variability
% - TLS connections are required (almost) everywhere
% - If somebody steals access token they can use it elsewhere
% - The authorization server can also issue refresh token, which
%   can be used to obtain another access token once the current one expires
